Example of how to use tools with test set of images and YOLO anotations (subsection320.zip).

The original images for subset are from:
**[Chula-RBC-12 DatasetÂ is a dataset of red blood cell](https://github.com/Chula-PIC-Lab/Chula-RBC-12-Dataset)**
Chula-RBC-12 Dataset is a dataset of red blood cell (RBC) blood smear images used in "Red Blood Cell Segmentation with Overlapping Cell Separation and Classification from an Imbalanced Dataset", containing 12 classes of RBC types consisting of 706 smear images that contain over 20,000 RBC cells. The dataset was collected at the Oxidation in Red Cell Disorders Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University in 2019 using a DS-Fi2-L3 Nikon microscope at 1000x magnification.
