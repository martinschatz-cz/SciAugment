# SciAugment
SciAugment aims to provide tools for image augmentation for object detection (YOLO) based on machine on which images were taken.

# Examples
Example Google Colab notebook shows simple use of augmentation of both image and YOLO anotation. Result is prepared train_data folder with 70/30 train/test distribution.

# SciCount
SciAugment is part of [SciCount](https://github.com/martinschatz-cz/SciCount) project.
